[10/22/24, 2:04:18 PM] Jason Mack: Also, he only did masters because he didn't get job right out of bachelors and he did it in 3 years

[10/22/24, 2:07:02 PM] Chrissy Collins: i think navo should just start wearing cardigans and maybe hell get a google internship
[10/22/24, 2:07:05 PM] Jason Mack: He is a conterizaition(spelling?) lover

[10/22/24, 2:08:21 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: Flannel yeah
[10/22/24, 2:08:29 PM] Jason Mack: I think cardigan is just very different from his fashion

[10/22/24, 2:08:46 PM] Navodit Maheshwari: the grey one
[10/22/24, 2:08:48 PM] Jason Mack: Like arnav with cardigan is normal but arnav with flannel is not
[10/22/24, 2:09:07 PM] Chrissy Collins: yeah thats why i was confused by this guy cuz the cardigan did not go with the funky sea shell shorts and running shoes
[10/22/24, 2:09:14 PM] Jason Mack: Inverse is true for navo
[10/22/24, 2:09:49 PM] Jason Mack: Zoom only shows torso chrissy, it's optimal interview fit

[11/1/24, 2:18:55 PM] Jason Mack: Just go to ace with the same type of screw and get another one. I'm assuming the stand has at least one other screw that you can take off

[11/4/24, 1:20:24 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: Lowkey like before the distributed midterm people were talking about distance vector algorithm
[11/4/24, 1:20:41 PM] Samantha Holmen: what does that mean
[11/4/24, 1:20:45 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: And I thought they were joking and made that term up to troll and make people think they didn’t study
[11/4/24, 1:20:47 PM] Jason Mack: I don't think anyone thought that was going to be a major question
[11/4/24, 1:20:53 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: But it ended up being like 20% of the midterm
[11/4/24, 1:21:05 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: Yeah
[11/4/24, 1:21:27 PM] Jason Mack: People were discussing a concept right before the test that ended up being 1/5th of the point on the test
[11/4/24, 1:23:33 PM] Jason Mack: I was so confused since i didn't know the name of the algorithm but i knew the algorithm
[11/4/24, 1:57:06 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: Is it just me or does campus feel very empty today
[11/4/24, 1:57:35 PM] Cheuk Pui Lam: It does
[11/4/24, 1:57:40 PM] Cheuk Pui Lam: I’ve never seen a bus this empty

[11/4/24, 2:00:46 PM] Sophie Han: i went to perk and all the seats were taken that shit pissed me off
[11/4/24, 2:01:18 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: Which perk
[11/4/24, 2:01:30 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: Quarry plaza, baskin, and kresge all very empty
[11/4/24, 2:02:36 PM] Sophie Han: interesting
[11/4/24, 2:10:05 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: bro
[11/4/24, 2:10:16 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: Pete Buttigieg in a Jubilee video
[11/4/24, 3:09:13 PM] Jason Mack: Why is district 1 stuck between choosing a pro-life assemblywoman, or a pro-book banning assemblywoman
[11/4/24, 3:10:17 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: LOL
[11/4/24, 3:10:20 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: average grass valley
[11/4/24, 3:10:36 PM] Jason Mack: This is all of district 1 tho
[11/4/24, 3:10:37 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: tbh i would choose the pro-life one because book banning is more likely to hit at the local level
[11/4/24, 3:10:40 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: ah
[11/4/24, 3:11:02 PM] Jason Mack: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/17/California%27s_1st_Assembly_district.svg

[11/4/24, 3:11:18 PM] Jason Mack: Embed fail
[11/4/24, 3:11:20 PM] Cheuk Pui Lam: As in people who need it can probably drive a bit to get abortion anyways?
[11/4/24, 3:11:25 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: wait thats crazy i didn’t know district 1 was that big
[11/4/24, 3:11:31 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: no like
[11/4/24, 3:11:56 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: well kind of but abortion is safer in california
[11/4/24, 3:12:03 PM] Jason Mack: The issue is both have horrible websites and i can barely find the issues they care about
[11/4/24, 3:12:13 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: like it’s not really easy to ban abortion on a local level
[11/4/24, 3:12:22 PM] Jason Mack: Yeah
[11/4/24, 3:12:24 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: especially in california
[11/4/24, 3:12:32 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: but for book banning it is, especially in a district like that one
[11/4/24, 3:12:46 PM] Cheuk Pui Lam: Yeah that makes sense
[11/4/24, 3:12:48 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: i don’t know if that makes sense
[11/4/24, 3:13:26 PM] Jason Mack: It was said very subtly tho but the intent was still there. There was just a piece of a sentence mentioning removing sexually explicit content from schools
[11/4/24, 3:13:35 PM] Cheuk Pui Lam: It does
[11/4/24, 3:17:00 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: Average local election
[11/4/24, 3:17:18 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: It was so hard to do Lathrop research
[11/4/24, 3:18:53 PM] Jason Mack: Im voting pro life since thr book banner's solution to rising insurance costs is "free market principles", which are the exact reasons costs are going up rn
[11/4/24, 3:37:54 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: Damn
[11/4/24, 3:38:35 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: Also does anyone wanna go downtown Santa Cruz tomorrow night

[11/4/24, 4:52:35 PM] Jason Mack: P->Q does not imply !P->Q

[11/5/24, 1:59:41 PM] Jason Mack: If you are downtown and drinking you can't show the alcohol so you'd have to put it in a waterbottle or something
[11/5/24, 2:00:04 PM] Jason Mack: We can also just go to someone's dorm
[11/5/24, 2:00:36 PM] Bill Mularski: bro we can just drink later if we really want to
[11/5/24, 2:01:47 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: LOL
[11/5/24, 2:01:54 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: yeah i don’t really care that much about it
[11/5/24, 2:02:02 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: i think downtown might be cool tho
[11/5/24, 2:02:05 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: i just don’t know what time
[11/5/24, 2:02:17 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: i guess depending on what time stuff gets called?
[11/5/24, 2:02:36 PM] Jason Mack: Also, where would we go to watch since we can't go into bars? Would any restaurants be open late and airing it?
[11/5/24, 2:02:48 PM] Jason Mack: It also might get called tomorrow
[11/5/24, 2:02:57 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: yeah that’s what i don’t really know about
[11/5/24, 2:03:20 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: idk i just saw on reddit that downtown might get very lively
[11/5/24, 2:07:36 PM] Jason Mack: We can listen to ksqd. Rachel Goodman might be the MC. She did it two years ago
[11/5/24, 2:08:56 PM] Jason Mack: Also looking at the reddit it seems like it will be a big celebration if harris wins and if trump wins everyone will just clear out when they call it. That's what they said has happened in past years
[11/5/24, 2:11:20 PM] Cheuk Pui Lam: I’m not doing anything tn
‎[11/5/24, 2:11:22 PM] Jason Mack: ‎image omitted

[11/5/24, 2:13:38 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: voter turnout would increase so much if that was the sticker you got
[11/5/24, 2:13:41 PM] Jason Mack: If i remember i might've made a whole bunch at slugworks
[11/5/24, 2:14:13 PM] Jason Mack: Like imagine walking around campus with that
[11/5/24, 2:14:26 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: for real

[11/5/24, 2:14:46 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: its the sticker in michigan
[11/5/24, 2:14:54 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: a 12 year old designed it during a competition
‎[11/5/24, 2:14:58 PM] Jason Mack: ‎image omitted
[11/5/24, 2:15:12 PM] Jason Mack: These were the stickers they had last election i think
[11/5/24, 2:15:27 PM] Jason Mack: I like the right middle and bottom right ones too

[11/5/24, 2:20:16 PM] Navodit Maheshwari: the lighthouse and the cat one are pretty cool
[11/5/24, 2:20:22 PM] Jason Mack: I saw people saying they have a no politics policy so they won't
[11/5/24, 2:20:25 PM] Jason Mack: I could be wrong tho
[11/5/24, 2:20:32 PM] Samantha Holmen: hmm yeah
[11/5/24, 2:20:51 PM] Jason Mack: This is info from a reddit comment so it's not very solid evidence
[11/5/24, 2:20:55 PM] Samantha Holmen: I don't think most of the bars dt have tvs anyways
[11/5/24, 2:21:18 PM] Samantha Holmen: you'd have to find like a sports bar or something
[11/5/24, 2:21:21 PM] Jason Mack: We can be like the people on halloween and bring a couch and a tv
[11/5/24, 2:21:33 PM] Jason Mack: They only had the couch though
[11/5/24, 2:22:11 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: i don’t think it’ll be like a tv screening i think it’ll just be a big celebration like halloween
[11/5/24, 2:22:14 PM] Jason Mack: I could unironically do that since i have a tv and couch in my garage that are both unused
[11/5/24, 2:22:25 PM] Jason Mack: Ye
[11/5/24, 2:22:40 PM] Halle Allen: What am I reading
[11/5/24, 2:22:41 PM] Jason Mack: I feel like i'll just be checking my phone constantly tho
[11/5/24, 2:24:08 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: what are the odds ted cruz gets booted
[11/5/24, 2:24:44 PM] Jason Mack: Idk his opponent but i remember people were pissed at him during the winter storm a few years ago
[11/5/24, 2:26:09 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: yeah
[11/5/24, 2:26:09 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: i think there would be a good demographic that vote for trump but against cruz
[11/5/24, 2:31:10 PM] Jason Mack: Going to school with my ballot and liquor is a strange feeling
[11/5/24, 2:31:44 PM] Halle Allen: Wait I read everything but still confused what’s going on
[11/5/24, 2:32:11 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: Freedom 🇺🇸🇺🇸

[11/5/24, 2:33:34 PM] Jason Mack: Oh ok
[11/5/24, 2:33:49 PM] Jason Mack: Is this for drop off or actual voting
[11/5/24, 2:33:54 PM] Sophie Han: both
[11/5/24, 2:34:25 PM] Jason Mack: I'm going to drop mine off at quarry plaza soon
[11/5/24, 2:35:23 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: Huge
[11/5/24, 2:36:24 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: Wait how is there a line for drop off
[11/5/24, 2:36:37 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: Actually lowkey makes sense there were a ton of people dropping off yesterday within like a 2 minute span
[11/5/24, 2:37:10 PM] Jason Mack: I might be late to class, i need to drop off ballot at quarry and then alc at your place arnav
[11/5/24, 2:37:16 PM] Jason Mack: Will there be someone at the dorm?

[11/5/24, 2:58:40 PM] Jason Mack: I can't open it
[11/5/24, 2:58:56 PM] Halle Allen: If you guys do go downtown be careful
[11/5/24, 3:00:15 PM] Jason Mack: They’re counting votes, we’re counting sips! Grab a drink and play along: 🥂 One sip: Every time you hear “too close to call,” “unprecedented times,” “record turnout,” “youth vote,” or “suburban women” ✌🏼Two sips: A state flips from one party to another, they talk about the “path to 270,” or there’s a split screen of both candidates’ HQs 🤞Three sips: Mention of a recount or legal challenge, or the news anchor looks visibly exhausted. 🍾Finish your drink: If the presidency is called or someone concedes! Let’s make it a night to remember… or not!
[11/5/24, 3:00:30 PM] Jason Mack: I found the video description
[11/5/24, 3:00:38 PM] Samantha Holmen: that sums it up
[11/5/24, 3:00:49 PM] Jason Mack: I think a state flipping should be a shot
[11/5/24, 3:01:04 PM] Sophie Han: california turns red down the bottle
[11/5/24, 3:01:30 PM] Jason Mack: If texas turns blue this year i think that's like 5 shots
[11/5/24, 3:01:32 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: If Florida or Texas flip that’s 3 shots
[11/5/24, 3:01:38 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: If Iowa or Indiana flip that’s 2
[11/5/24, 3:01:52 PM] Jason Mack: Isn't iowa a decently likely one tho
[11/5/24, 3:02:03 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: If the dems keep the senate then that’s 1
[11/5/24, 3:02:11 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: Yeah
[11/5/24, 3:02:27 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: okay iowa and Indiana
[11/5/24, 3:02:43 PM] Cheuk Pui Lam: I don’t think so

[11/5/24, 3:04:34 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: I bet li Liu broke in and took it
[11/5/24, 3:05:30 PM] Sophie Han: case of the missing rum

[11/13/24, 4:57:56 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: Lowkey still haven’t decided my third class
[11/13/24, 4:58:03 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: Any recommendations
[11/13/24, 4:58:13 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: For CS electives or ER or CC
[11/13/24, 5:01:48 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: hmm li has a 5 on RMP but only for non stat 131 classes https://www.ratemyprofessors.com/professor/2710655
[11/13/24, 5:01:55 PM] Cheuk Pui Lam: Take a math class for cs elective
[11/13/24, 5:02:32 PM] Jason Mack: Intro to databases?
[11/13/24, 5:03:03 PM] Jason Mack: I'm down for the gamble. People say the other prof is generous with grading but is a bad lecturer if i remember
[11/13/24, 5:03:31 PM] Sophie Han: Ballet I for ER
[11/13/24, 5:04:03 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: i think both of them seem like good options
[11/13/24, 5:04:19 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: marcela is apparently like very doable A
[11/13/24, 5:04:50 PM] Jason Mack: But he's also at 9:20 am
[11/13/24, 5:04:51 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: maybe but how rigerous would this be i don’t want 3 cooked classes again
[11/13/24, 5:05:00 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: is it good
[11/13/24, 5:05:07 PM] Jason Mack: No clue i'm gamblemaxing this quarter
[11/13/24, 5:05:23 PM] Cheuk Pui Lam: W
[11/13/24, 5:05:41 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: do not recommend gamblemaxing
[11/13/24, 5:05:44 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: did that with cryptography
[11/13/24, 5:05:51 PM] Jason Mack: Three classes with questionable profs and one that i've heard nothing about
[11/13/24, 5:06:16 PM] Jason Mack: Yeah but i'm pretty sure databases are useful/interesting to me regardless
[11/13/24, 5:06:30 PM] Jason Mack: And the other two classes are mandatory
[11/13/24, 5:07:12 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: bro i just wish more people taught cse150 networking

[11/13/24, 5:07:53 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: yeah
[11/13/24, 5:07:57 PM] Jason Mack: Because i also looked at it and thought the same thing
[11/13/24, 5:07:58 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: fair
[11/13/24, 5:08:46 PM] Jason Mack: A 9am with a bad lecturer is a surefire way to get me to skip most lectures
[11/13/24, 5:09:45 PM] Cheuk Pui Lam: A bad lecturer is a surefire way to get me to skip most lectures
[11/13/24, 5:09:56 PM] Jason Mack: Yeah
[11/13/24, 5:11:02 PM] Jovany Jimenez: A lecture is a surefire way to get me to skip lecture

[11/13/24, 9:40:44 PM] Jason Mack: Arnav when he isn't up 100% 10 sec after buying
[11/13/24, 9:41:12 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: ok but down 70 cents in less than 10 sec is crazy
[11/13/24, 9:41:55 PM] Jason Mack: Bitcoin is up so much rn i kinda want to sell
[11/13/24, 9:42:28 PM] Jason Mack: It's high rn and it moves a lot
[11/13/24, 9:42:31 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: Don’t fold
[11/13/24, 9:42:39 PM] Jason Mack: I won't
[11/13/24, 9:42:40 PM] Elyas Gharavi: Could be worth selling
[11/13/24, 9:42:44 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: Unless you need the money rn
[11/13/24, 9:42:46 PM] Jason Mack: Maybe i will?
[11/13/24, 9:42:52 PM] Elyas Gharavi: I don't think this is the top tho
[11/13/24, 9:42:58 PM] Jason Mack: It's really high and it could crash
[11/13/24, 9:42:59 PM] Elyas Gharavi: So it would be just to take the profit
[11/13/24, 9:43:11 PM] Elyas Gharavi: In the long run it'll be higher
[11/13/24, 9:43:38 PM] Jason Mack: Yeah it's just gambling if it'll go below what i bought it at
[11/13/24, 9:43:52 PM] Elyas Gharavi: On the other hand if you sell now and it peaks at like 150k you'll be pretty bummed haha
[11/13/24, 9:44:16 PM] Elyas Gharavi: I mean as long as it goes lower than it is now you'll  buy in for more
[11/13/24, 9:44:18 PM] Jason Mack: Yeah i don't plan on selling but i'm not gonna buy anytime soon either
[11/13/24, 9:44:31 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: If it goes down to 70k again it could be worth selling now and just buying again then
[11/13/24, 9:44:49 PM] Jason Mack: I could also just hold and buy more if it does that

[12/12/24, 8:45:13 PM] Cheuk Pui Lam: We hanging out in Jason’s living room if y’all wanna pull up
[12/12/24, 8:45:47 PM] Navodit Maheshwari: Lowkey easier for you guys to drive up then for us to bus down
[12/12/24, 8:45:52 PM] Cheuk Pui Lam: True
[12/12/24, 8:45:56 PM] Cheuk Pui Lam: What if I drive y’all down
[12/12/24, 8:46:02 PM] Navodit Maheshwari: Then I would come
[12/12/24, 8:46:08 PM] Cheuk Pui Lam: Nvm Jason says he’s gonna work

[12/12/24, 10:48:32 PM] Sakshi Konnur: Yeah imma just take a call tomorrow morning if that's okay!
[12/13/24, 8:42:21 AM] Sakshi Konnur: So I'm actually feeling okay today and would be down for anything (including going to Santa clara + movie)
[12/13/24, 8:43:23 AM] Sakshi Konnur: I realize that the good seats for interstellar are already kinda taken but if people don't mind being split up, I think we should be chilling
[12/13/24, 8:45:38 AM] Sakshi Konnur: Bill mentioned something about wanting to leave later in the day, I'm fine with that too, but imo we should start heading back by 8:30 p.m. since it's projected to rain heavily starting at 10. Driving on 17 while it's dark and rainy is a risk we can avoid ‎<This message was edited>
[12/13/24, 10:06:10 AM] Arnav Vishwakarma: I agree, we should leave earlier and come back earlier since it’s a long movie
[12/13/24, 10:06:17 AM] Arnav Vishwakarma: We can look for seats now and book
[12/13/24, 10:06:23 AM] Arnav Vishwakarma: It doesn’t even have to be Mercado

[12/13/24, 11:50:25 AM] Arnav Vishwakarma: lowkey idk if I will basketball
[12/13/24, 11:50:37 AM] Arnav Vishwakarma: for people going to movie which one and where

[12/13/24, 11:58:05 AM] Elyas Gharavi: What time would we be going?

[12/13/24, 12:01:05 PM] Jason Mack: I'll be real i don't really want to watch a movie but i'd be down to drive people there and then walk around somewhere and then grab everyone to do something afterwards
[12/13/24, 12:01:55 PM] Jason Mack: It's an hour drive so we'd have to leave at like 2pm
[12/13/24, 12:02:08 PM] Halle Allen: I will continue to lurk
[12/13/24, 12:02:39 PM] Sakshi Konnur: How does everyone feel about escape room instead? 👀
[12/13/24, 12:02:49 PM] Sakshi Konnur: I can do some research rn
[12/13/24, 12:02:52 PM] Jason Mack: I'd be down

[12/13/24, 12:03:40 PM] Cheuk Pui Lam: Ok down
[12/13/24, 12:13:30 PM] Sakshi Konnur: So they are kinda pricy, so no worries if we wanna do something else, 
I've been to Breakout Studios in San Jose and it's nice, they have a couple of missions that are made for 2-8 players, it'll be around $35 per person

[12/13/24, 12:18:40 PM] Cheuk Pui Lam: Let’s meet at Jason’s at 2 and then figure out from there?
[12/13/24, 12:23:27 PM] Elyas Gharavi: I will probably have to skip
[12/13/24, 12:23:57 PM] Cheuk Pui Lam: I’m down for whatever
[12/13/24, 12:24:45 PM] Angelina Cruz: I should probably stay local
[12/13/24, 12:25:05 PM] Sakshi Konnur: Bill said he'll be free after around 3:30ish
[12/13/24, 12:28:07 PM] Sakshi Konnur: Currently, these are the people I'm including if we decide to leave at 3:30:

Sophie
Cheuk
Jason

[12/13/24, 12:28:28 PM] Elyas Gharavi: If we leave at 3:30 then I can make it
[12/13/24, 12:28:58 PM] Sophie Han: leave at 3:30 for escape room or movie
[12/13/24, 12:29:50 PM] Cheuk Pui Lam: Can we do a quick vote for movie vs escape room
[12/13/24, 12:30:04 PM] Cheuk Pui Lam: Movie
[12/13/24, 12:30:05 PM] Cheuk Pui Lam: Escape room
[12/13/24, 12:30:07 PM] Cheuk Pui Lam: React
[12/13/24, 12:30:07 PM] Sophie Han: sakshi gets 2 votes cuz it’s her birthday :3
[12/13/24, 12:30:22 PM] Cheuk Pui Lam: TRUE
[12/13/24, 12:31:13 PM] Cheuk Pui Lam: Sorry Arnav
[12/13/24, 12:32:52 PM] Sakshi Konnur: pros of escape room:
- more timing options
- can leave at a reasonable time and be back by a reasonable time
- fun?? activity??
cons of escape room:
- expensive
- may not be fun (too difficult or too easy)
- $10 more expensive then movie

pros of movie:
- interstellar!!!! 
- vibes 
cons of movie:
- really long
- if we leave at 3:30, hardly any showings until like 6:30 at which point it'll be too late to head back
[12/13/24, 12:33:34 PM] Cheuk Pui Lam: Let’s do escape room
[12/13/24, 12:40:45 PM] Sakshi Konnur: by the way, this was purely arbitrary, other people can join too! I think we'll need 2 cars anyways so there's still space
[12/13/24, 12:42:29 PM] Cheuk Pui Lam: How many spots in your car @15307988344
[12/13/24, 12:44:06 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: I think 7
[12/13/24, 12:44:21 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: (I’m down to cram in Jason’s car and just do 1 car)
[12/13/24, 12:44:32 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: nvm there’s 8 rn
[12/13/24, 12:44:35 PM] Jason Mack: Up to 7
[12/13/24, 12:44:50 PM] Jason Mack: 2 cars makes most sense
[12/13/24, 12:45:56 PM] Cheuk Pui Lam: Let’s do 2 cars and pray I don’t lock in too hard
[12/13/24, 12:46:16 PM] Jason Mack: Also are we doing dinner down there?

[12/13/24, 12:48:26 PM] Sakshi Konnur: There's this place called LeYou Ethiopian that I really liked but it might be too adventurous for such a big group
[12/13/24, 12:48:59 PM] Sakshi Konnur: I'm currently thinking either thai or korean
[12/13/24, 12:49:04 PM] Cheuk Pui Lam: Not Japanese????

[12/13/24, 12:53:20 PM] Jason Mack: If you really want to test it half can take it in each car, and then one car drives very carefully and the other fast and swerving a lot and then we can collect data to find if it works
[12/13/24, 12:53:33 PM] Sakshi Konnur: LMAO

[12/13/24, 12:53:59 PM] Sophie Han: i’m just scared of side effects tho (mild drowsiness) so i don’t want to risk
[12/13/24, 12:54:05 PM] Cheuk Pui Lam: I can also drive fast for those who want to lock in 😈
[12/13/24, 12:54:09 PM] Jason Mack: Who would volunteer to be in the fast car with no medicine
[12/13/24, 12:54:10 PM] Sophie Han: don’t want half the group to be snoozed before we even enter the escape room

[12/13/24, 2:59:57 PM] Sakshi Konnur: Also, thoughts on going to Sofa market instead of a restaurant? It's a food court in downtown SJ, so I feel like there would be more options for everyone
[12/13/24, 3:01:31 PM] Sakshi Konnur: Not sure, depends on when everyone else is ready
[12/13/24, 3:04:54 PM] Cheuk Pui Lam: Ok someone call me when I should head out

[12/16/24, 10:51:21 PM] Sophie Han: this is a first degree murder attempt
[12/16/24, 10:51:24 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: Lowkey I should do that with bill
[12/16/24, 10:51:38 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: Next time he says he’s going to bed but then microwaves popcorn and watches tv on his phone in the dark
[12/16/24, 10:51:44 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: I’ll be the one laughing

[12/16/24, 10:52:41 PM] Cagn Steinbrecher: So he doesn't get hurt too bad
[12/16/24, 10:52:50 PM] Sophie Han: lmaoo
[12/16/24, 10:53:01 PM] Sophie Han: i saw bill wearing socks for the first time the other day
[12/16/24, 10:53:18 PM] Sophie Han: i feel like everytime i see him he got his dawgs out
[12/16/24, 10:53:35 PM] Angelina Cruz: Sophie that's a crazy observation
[12/16/24, 10:53:49 PM] Sophie Han: it IS an observation tho
[12/16/24, 10:56:31 PM] Jason Mack: Also, i had idea for project on drive home and i wanted to hear if you guys think this is a fun idea
[12/16/24, 10:56:41 PM] Cheuk Pui Lam: Let him cook
[12/16/24, 10:56:46 PM] Sophie Han: let him cook
[12/16/24, 10:57:14 PM] Jason Mack: Basically just an app where you can make chat rooms with people that are very close to you. Sort of like pictochat
[12/16/24, 10:57:45 PM] Jason Mack: Just an app where if you turn jt on and someone near you also has it open in the background it will send you both a notification where you can open a little chatroom
[12/16/24, 10:58:07 PM] Sophie Han: oooo
[12/16/24, 10:58:11 PM] Sophie Han: that’s super cool
[12/16/24, 10:58:14 PM] Angelina Cruz: That's kinda cute
[12/16/24, 10:58:18 PM] Sophie Han: yeahhh!
[12/16/24, 10:58:19 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: How close
[12/16/24, 10:58:23 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: Lowkey a banger
[12/16/24, 10:58:26 PM] Jason Mack: So if you are on the bus lr around campus and someone else has the app too you could send messages and drawings
[12/16/24, 10:58:27 PM] Sophie Han: imagine the airplane conversations
[12/16/24, 10:58:31 PM] Sophie Han: and the road rage
[12/16/24, 10:58:32 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: If someone’s stinky in the library you could talk shit about them
[12/16/24, 10:58:37 PM] Sophie Han: LMAO
[12/16/24, 10:58:43 PM] Jason Mack: I was thinking fairly small area. Like half a mile at most
[12/16/24, 10:58:45 PM] Sophie Han: wait will it be anonymous or account based
[12/16/24, 10:58:47 PM] Sophie Han: oooo
[12/16/24, 10:58:47 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: Or use it for other more wholesome lurposes
[12/16/24, 10:58:56 PM] Cheuk Pui Lam: Down
[12/16/24, 10:59:02 PM] Sophie Han: no wholesome purposes
[12/16/24, 10:59:05 PM] Jason Mack: I was thinking make it so you have a username that you could change at any time
[12/16/24, 10:59:12 PM] Sakshi Konnur: Twitch chat during lectures
[12/16/24, 10:59:15 PM] Jason Mack: Just to prevent stalker situations
[12/16/24, 10:59:22 PM] Jason Mack: I didn't even think about that
[12/16/24, 10:59:25 PM] Sophie Han: mmm right
[12/16/24, 10:59:32 PM] Sophie Han: omg twitch chat
[12/16/24, 10:59:38 PM] Sophie Han: that’s cool
[12/16/24, 10:59:40 PM] Sophie Han: i like it
[12/16/24, 10:59:48 PM] Cheuk Pui Lam: Probably add a report function maybe?
[12/16/24, 10:59:55 PM] Sophie Han: IP ban
[12/16/24, 11:00:30 PM] Cheuk Pui Lam: Account ban also works
[12/16/24, 11:00:33 PM] Cheuk Pui Lam: That sounds fun
[12/16/24, 11:01:19 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: Account ban if you forget your password
[12/16/24, 11:01:20 PM] Jason Mack: I think being able to change display names at any time would also be a good feature for that
[12/16/24, 11:01:24 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: (There’s no reset feature)
[12/16/24, 11:01:29 PM] Jason Mack: Kinda like yikyak
[12/16/24, 11:01:32 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: yeah
[12/16/24, 11:01:39 PM] Sophie Han: cruzhacks reference
[12/16/24, 11:01:40 PM] Jason Mack: Sophie catching strays rn
[12/16/24, 11:01:40 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: would this be a web app or an actual mobile app
[12/16/24, 11:01:46 PM] Jason Mack: Mobile
[12/16/24, 11:01:55 PM] Jason Mack: I wouldn't use it if it was a web app
[12/16/24, 11:01:58 PM] Sophie Han: shiet
[12/16/24, 11:02:08 PM] Sophie Han: we have to fight apple developer contracts
[12/16/24, 11:02:25 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: I agree
[12/16/24, 11:02:43 PM] Sophie Han: not xcode being like 20 gigs
[12/16/24, 11:02:44 PM] Jason Mack: Maybe only apple support at first just for personal convenience
[12/16/24, 11:02:56 PM] Sophie Han: yea
[12/16/24, 11:03:01 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: How would it be hosted
[12/16/24, 11:03:11 PM] Jason Mack: My pc as of now
[12/16/24, 11:03:11 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: P2P
[12/16/24, 11:03:14 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: LOL
[12/16/24, 11:03:14 PM] Sophie Han: *firebase*
[12/16/24, 11:03:16 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: yeah that’s fair
[12/16/24, 11:03:27 PM] Jason Mack: P2p would drain phone battery
[12/16/24, 11:03:58 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: It’s also a lot harder to do LOL
[12/16/24, 11:04:15 PM] Jason Mack: I was thinking if i get it to a working status just make it region locked to santa cruz rn
[12/16/24, 11:04:18 PM] Cheuk Pui Lam: Is this your 115a project or
[12/16/24, 11:04:23 PM] Jason Mack: For fun
[12/16/24, 11:04:28 PM] Jason Mack: And resume
[12/16/24, 11:04:38 PM] Cheuk Pui Lam: Down
[12/16/24, 11:04:44 PM] Cheuk Pui Lam: Huge project idea
[12/16/24, 11:04:49 PM] Jason Mack: I feel like i would genuinely use this also
[12/16/24, 11:05:02 PM] Sophie Han: yeah
[12/16/24, 11:06:29 PM] Cheuk Pui Lam: Yeah
[12/16/24, 11:08:44 PM] Sakshi Konnur: If you wanted to let's say, increase the location radius to capture everyone in a lecture hall, do you think the user would need to manually increase the radius or should there be an option to create temporary chat rooms that people can join with a code kahoot-style
[12/16/24, 11:09:21 PM] Jason Mack: I was thinking you just have to choose to be a host and when you do anyone in the area can join
[12/16/24, 11:09:26 PM] Cheuk Pui Lam: Yes
[12/16/24, 11:09:32 PM] Cheuk Pui Lam: And maybe add private rooms
[12/16/24, 11:09:41 PM] Jason Mack: Maybe give the host permission to kick people or lock room
[12/16/24, 11:09:50 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: So if you host a rooom
[12/16/24, 11:09:57 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: It would send a notif to people in a nearby area?
[12/16/24, 11:10:41 PM] Cheuk Pui Lam: Maybe just let people join within that area?
[12/16/24, 11:10:42 PM] Jason Mack: Yeah like if i choose to host the room and you walk into my range you would get a notification saying something like user "Jason" room in range, do you want to join
[12/16/24, 11:10:50 PM] Cheuk Pui Lam: Like a search page maybe ?
[12/16/24, 11:11:18 PM] Jason Mack: That would probably be my first implemebtation is make it just show all rooms in an area around you
[12/16/24, 11:12:13 PM] Jason Mack: I think notifications is an end goal since i wouldn't want to have to keep checking the app to see if anyone is there. I feel like that's nice too since you wouldn't need to think about the app until it tells you someone's room is nearby
[12/16/24, 11:19:56 PM] Sakshi Konnur: I also think it could be cool to have a couple of permanent chat rooms!! Like McHenry, you wouldn't want a chat to end when the host has to leave. It seems like a good way to de-stress when you're taking a break from studying (as opposed to just brain rotting)
[12/16/24, 11:21:24 PM] Mani Hari: Holy shit no way bro still does that
‎[12/16/24, 11:21:33 PM] Mani Hari: ‎sticker omitted
[12/16/24, 11:21:53 PM] Mani Hari: bro I swear to god I would just put my hand out for popcorn at like 2 AM and I would receive some no questions asked
[12/16/24, 11:21:59 PM] Mani Hari: real asf
[12/16/24, 11:23:07 PM] Cheuk Pui Lam: I think notifications r gonna be too annoying
[12/16/24, 11:25:04 PM] Jason Mack: I think it would just be that you turn on like an active listener mode where you want to check that. I was mosty thinking notifications would be nice at the start since if there's a small user base it'll be annoying to have to check for rooms and there most likely not being one. I feel like notifications being a problem is only an issue for if it gets a substabtial user base
[12/17/24, 12:56:09 AM] Samantha Holmen: this is a CRAZY suggestion
[12/17/24, 12:56:18 AM] Samantha Holmen: Arnav you're gonna start getting bullied next
[12/17/24, 12:56:36 AM] Cheuk Pui Lam: Arnav also lives on top bunk
[12/17/24, 12:56:54 AM] Samantha Holmen: I'm gonna come over with a screwdriver

[12/17/24, 4:16:02 PM] Samantha Holmen: it's giving republican
[12/17/24, 4:16:04 PM] Cagn Steinbrecher: You forgot to tell us not to show up to school
[12/17/24, 4:16:29 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: School shooter with a shotgun is crazy
[12/17/24, 4:16:49 PM] Jason Mack: Not shotgun
[12/17/24, 4:17:05 PM] Jason Mack: Looks like a 22?
[12/17/24, 4:17:28 PM] Jason Mack: Which is even wilder
[12/17/24, 4:17:49 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: What’s the difference
[12/17/24, 4:18:20 PM] Cagn Steinbrecher: A shotgun doesn't have a rifled barrel
[12/17/24, 4:18:20 PM] Bill Mularski: ok jason mack
[12/17/24, 4:18:22 PM] Jason Mack: Shotgun shoots a bunch of pellets or slugs. Also the barrel is smooth
[12/17/24, 4:18:27 PM] Bill Mularski: mr gun knower
[12/17/24, 4:18:43 PM] Cagn Steinbrecher: Generally you wouldn't stick a scope on a shotgun
[12/17/24, 4:19:05 PM] Jason Mack: 22 is a rifle so it has rifling or a spiral inside the barrel to make it more accurate like a football spiral
[12/17/24, 4:19:17 PM] Jason Mack: 22 is just the size of the bullet also
[12/17/24, 4:19:23 PM] Bill Mularski: yes
[12/17/24, 4:19:27 PM] Jason Mack: .22 inch
[12/17/24, 4:19:27 PM] Bill Mularski: semi automatic
[12/17/24, 4:19:44 PM] Cagn Steinbrecher: Very cool
[12/17/24, 4:20:26 PM] Jason Mack: I'll be real i don't know if ive seen a 22 with a scope on it usually it's just the little iron sights
[12/17/24, 4:51:58 PM] Mani Hari: woah bill hunting? double or single barrel? I can see like a little coupling on the end but I can’t tell at this angle
[12/17/24, 4:53:45 PM] Bill Mularski: no hunting, just shooting it a few times with family
[12/17/24, 4:53:52 PM] Bill Mularski: and just single barrel rifle
[12/17/24, 4:54:43 PM] Mani Hari: damn bro just has a rifle sitting around
[12/17/24, 4:54:51 PM] Mani Hari: Go hunt in the Oregon wilderness
[12/17/24, 4:55:10 PM] Mani Hari: But why a scope then?
[12/17/24, 4:55:20 PM] Mani Hari: Bro is prepping for the elementary school 💀
[12/17/24, 4:55:28 PM] Jason Mack: For fun
[12/17/24, 4:55:48 PM] Jason Mack: Also you wouldn't ever hunt with a 22 unless you're hunting rats or something
[12/17/24, 4:56:20 PM] Mani Hari: Well that’s why I asked if it was double, at the corner of the photo
[12/17/24, 4:57:25 PM] Jason Mack: The little thing that looks like a barrel beneath the barrel is where the ammo goes. Also it's semi auto
[12/17/24, 4:57:25 PM] Mani Hari: they work fine for rabbits and foxes, which is pretty popular game
[12/17/24, 4:57:44 PM] Jason Mack: Can you legally hunt foxes?
[12/17/24, 4:58:09 PM] Mani Hari: I think u need some kind of permit in California
[12/17/24, 4:58:14 PM] Mani Hari: no clue about Oregon though

[12/21/24, 9:04:47 PM] Jason Mack: Also, it is over a 11 hour drive so if we want to one thing we can do is have each person burn a playlist into a cd for music? It's one thing i've heard that sounds fun

[12/21/24, 9:08:26 PM] Jason Mack: I'm assuming portland will be longest
[12/21/24, 9:08:51 PM] Navodit Maheshwari: I think we should all work on wishlist and decide from there
[12/21/24, 9:08:56 PM] Sophie Han: yea
[12/21/24, 9:09:07 PM] Navodit Maheshwari: Then we can allocate an appropriate amount of days for each city

[12/21/24, 9:14:27 PM] Jason Mack: That's a long time so don't worry if you don't get close to that
[12/21/24, 9:14:58 PM] Jason Mack: And we can always listen to other stuff, relisten, or do no music so it might not be a full 40 hours of music that we need
[12/21/24, 9:18:02 PM] Navodit Maheshwari: Can mine be 40 hours of talk Tuah and Theo von
[12/21/24, 9:18:43 PM] Jason Mack: As driver i have skip privilege so sure

[1/3/25, 12:14:47 PM] Cheuk Pui Lam: Wait you’re in Danville???
[1/3/25, 12:15:03 PM] Bill Mularski: just left

[1/3/25, 12:15:37 PM] Bill Mularski: oh my gyatt
[1/3/25, 12:16:19 PM] Navodit Maheshwari: Highway 17 looks pretty cool with the fog
[1/3/25, 12:16:54 PM] Bill Mularski: someones probably gonna die today because of that
[1/3/25, 12:17:33 PM] Cheuk Pui Lam: Hopefully NOT me
[1/3/25, 12:17:36 PM] Navodit Maheshwari: Hopefully not but the fog up in the trees and not really on the road
[1/3/25, 12:17:36 PM] Cheuk Pui Lam: Fingies crossed
[1/3/25, 12:31:48 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: highway 17 unironically would benefit from another lane
[1/3/25, 12:32:12 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: although it might make it more dangerous for people in the middle lane cause it’s harder to follow the curves without a barrier
[1/3/25, 12:33:13 PM] Cheuk Pui Lam: Is the traffic bad 😞
[1/3/25, 12:33:26 PM] Cheuk Pui Lam: Lowkey people just need to learn how to drive
[1/3/25, 12:33:39 PM] Mani Hari: Eh, I think it’s better if they widen the lanes cuz the borders really help at night ‎<This message was edited>
[1/3/25, 12:34:38 PM] Navodit Maheshwari: I think two lanes are fine, ppl just need to drive slower and there needs to be more traffic enforcement
[1/3/25, 12:34:54 PM] Navodit Maheshwari: Traffic is very chill rn
[1/3/25, 12:34:54 PM] Samantha Holmen: I agree with widening the lanes because I prefer to drive in the outside lane bc it usually has a little bit more of a margin
[1/3/25, 12:35:03 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: yeah that’s lowkey true
[1/3/25, 12:35:40 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: the big challenge is when there’s an inevitable crash and then both the lanes become bottlenecked
[1/3/25, 12:36:00 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: but the widening would also probably reduce crashes
[1/3/25, 12:36:22 PM] Cheuk Pui Lam: It doesn’t matter if there r two or three lanes it’s gonna block regardless
[1/3/25, 12:36:58 PM] Samantha Holmen: when I was leaving sc there was a car that skidded and was completely facing the wrong direction, which I feel is a lot of the issues in rainy season
[1/3/25, 12:37:08 PM] Samantha Holmen: which another lane wouldn't necessarily help
[1/3/25, 12:47:39 PM] Mani Hari: Gonna call myself out here but like yeah they need to actually enforce the radar speeds instead of just putting a fucking sign there cuz I’ve gone well over the speed limit in the speed zones and seen people whoosh past me on the left lane, which boggles my mind because I’m ALREADY going at like 80 how fucking fast ARE YOU going?!
[1/3/25, 3:29:54 PM] Sakshi Konnur: I'm with cheuk and getting this for you
[1/3/25, 3:30:21 PM] Sakshi Konnur: Does anyone else want anything from hmart or 85 degrees

Also how do you run out of the egg sandwich within the first hour of being open. Upon asking them if they are gonna restock, they straight up said idk. Surely you know if you have more egg sandwiches.

[1/13/25, 12:56:51 PM] Jason Mack: Also i have kikkoman soy sauce which isn't exactly what you're looking for but if you don't want to get light and dark soy sauce i'm pretty sure it substitutes for both

[1/30/25, 1:18:28 AM] Cagn Steinbrecher: Uh I think so? It's not really enforced though the govt is pretty lenient about giving you as many chances as possible to sign up
[1/30/25, 1:18:58 AM] Cagn Steinbrecher: Like ur supposed to do it within 3 weeks of turning 18 but no one is gonna come arrest you if u dont
[1/30/25, 1:19:25 AM] Cagn Steinbrecher: The big thing for us is you don't get FAFSA if u don't sign up

[1/30/25, 1:21:41 AM] Navodit Maheshwari: Ah I see thanks
[1/30/25, 1:21:54 AM] Cagn Steinbrecher: Dw too much about it
[1/30/25, 1:25:07 AM] Navodit Maheshwari: I was just curious cuz Chris told me that all males have to sign up to get aid
[1/30/25, 1:25:17 AM] Navodit Maheshwari: Plus it was also illegal to not do so
[1/30/25, 1:26:11 AM] Cagn Steinbrecher: Sounds like him

[2/14/25, 4:13:26 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: yeah like even if the car sick thing wasn’t an issue i don’t know if you’d want to risk getting pulled over

[2/14/25, 4:14:34 PM] Jason Mack: Yeah I'd rather not. What if something in santa cruz or nearby instead?

[2/14/25, 4:18:25 PM] Jason Mack: I'd rather do something in santa cruz with everyone
[2/14/25, 4:19:01 PM] Jason Mack: Like take 25 mg and walk around the circles for 10 hours
[2/14/25, 4:19:19 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: circles when you’re high is no joke
[2/14/25, 4:19:30 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: the lights from the markets look so trippy

[2/14/25, 4:33:58 PM] Jason Mack: We could also head over to capitola area?

[2/14/25, 4:34:44 PM] Jason Mack: I was thinking towards capitola but both are cool
[2/14/25, 4:35:09 PM] Jason Mack: Towards davenport goes by coastal campus and we could do rhe little aquarium there for free i think
[2/14/25, 4:35:11 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: also, if we really wanted to go to bay area, we could also just take the 17->caltrain somewhere
[2/14/25, 4:35:26 PM] Jason Mack: True
[2/14/25, 4:35:30 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: the caltrain drops you directly downtown in sunnyvale, mountain view, stanford, palo alto
[2/14/25, 4:35:34 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: and i think a few more
[2/14/25, 4:35:44 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: but it’ll be more expensive for transport cost per person
[2/14/25, 4:36:22 PM] Jason Mack: Amtrak goes to bakersfield???

[2/19/25, 12:08:40 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: Did you see the new executive order that dropped today
[2/19/25, 12:08:49 PM] Sophie Han: what dropped
[2/19/25, 12:10:10 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/ensuring-accountability-for-all-agencies/
[2/19/25, 12:10:10 PM] Cheuk Pui Lam: The one that says the AG decides what law means
[2/19/25, 12:10:12 PM] Cheuk Pui Lam: ?
[2/19/25, 12:10:39 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: Basically claims the AG and president are the interpreter of the law instead of the courts and the agencies

[2/19/25, 12:11:54 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: Lotta crazy shit in this one
[2/19/25, 12:17:27 PM] Sophie Han: (what’s AG)
[2/19/25, 12:17:57 PM] Cheuk Pui Lam: attorney general methinks
[2/19/25, 12:18:19 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: yeah attorney general
[2/19/25, 12:18:32 PM] Sophie Han: wait what does this mean
[2/19/25, 12:19:36 PM] Sophie Han: so more power for exec branch essentially?
[2/19/25, 12:19:57 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: yeah
[2/19/25, 12:20:25 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: congress passes law, executive branch enforces them, and judicial is supposed to interpret
[2/19/25, 12:20:42 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: but there are a ton of laws that are passed that the independent agencies have to interpret to enforce
[2/19/25, 12:21:08 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: a lot of them are non partisan and independent
[2/19/25, 12:21:46 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: like the FTC or FEC or FDA or EPA etc
[2/19/25, 12:22:34 PM] Sophie Han: oh shit
[2/19/25, 12:22:50 PM] Sophie Han: now idk much but this doesn’t seem very constitutional
[2/19/25, 12:22:52 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: but the order basically puts all of these agencies under White House control making them partisan and politiced, essentially a massive power overreach
[2/19/25, 12:22:59 PM] Sophie Han: yikes
[2/19/25, 12:23:05 PM] Sophie Han: rip checks and balances
[2/19/25, 12:23:27 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: it does stuff like putting officials from the White House in each agency to ensure that their operation strictly adheres to the agenda of the White House
[2/19/25, 12:23:40 PM] Sophie Han: mmmmmmmmm
[2/19/25, 12:24:34 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: one of the major things about this is that the White House is attempting to block funds that have been preapportioned by congress (which is the sole job of congress)
[2/19/25, 12:25:30 PM] Arnav Vishwakarma: and when you make things like the election commission partisan then yaknow
[2/19/25, 12:27:27 PM] Cheuk Pui Lam: Nobody cares about checks and balances anyways tbh
[2/19/25, 12:27:36 PM] Cheuk Pui Lam: Not even the Supreme Court
